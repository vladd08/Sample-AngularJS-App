# Sample-AngularJS-App
This is an AngularJS application which uses Gulp 4 for building and bundling. It uses everything AngularJS has to offer in terms of components (filters, directives, providers etc.). Everything in here is just a demonstration of architecturing, clean coding and using of AngularJS framework components.

Clone, npm install and 'gulp' :)
