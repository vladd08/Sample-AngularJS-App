# Sample-AngularJS-App
This project is an example of a clean, basic and production-ready folder structure and architecure using AngularJS. It also demonstrates how to cleanly write each AngularJS available component block (e.g directive, controller etc.)

A couple things you'll find inside:
* Development and production processing are the same thing, done by using Gulp 4 and other packages (babel, browserify, hinters etc.)
* Usage of vendor scripts added to the final app bundle
* One of each directive, component, controller, filter, service, factory, well written and well placed in a folder structure
* Unit-testing and coverage configuration with Karma & Jasmine
* Some custom wrappers to make things a bit more dev-friendly (Check ModuleHandler.js)
* Usage of some common-practiced UI scenarios like form validation, routing, url params decoupling & data displaying made quite simple and   clean

I do not claim this project or any of the contained code to be the source of truth or the best way one can possibly do this. Keep in mind that every software developer has its own needs and practices and might find code to be fit for his needs or not. Also, this is part of my self development and it's not intended to be maintained or made wide-public open, so don't rely on it for anything serious.
